Hello there!
Welcome to Jack Ruocco's Northwestern University Graduate School Portfolio.
He's been hard at work teaching himself how to code, script, do UX Design, and apply all of that to the private sector.
His life as an actor in LA (yes, really) feels like a LIFETIME ago.
Anywho, since you're here, feel free to look around at what Jack's been up to. Thanks! :D
