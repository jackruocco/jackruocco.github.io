        <p class="p-changes2">i was grateful that one of the first courses i took at Northwestern was about U.X. design.</p><br>
        <p class="p-changes2">in a term-long project (10 weeks), i was part of a team project tasked with designing something for tourists.</p><br>
        <p class="p-changes2">our only prompt? "make an app for someone that wants to explore a city."</p><br>
            <hr width="33%">
        <p class="p-changes2">our team discovered a need from travelling sports fans. these die-hards follow their favorite teams to "away" games in different cities, no matter how far.</p>
            <p class="p-changes2">they needed help with all the issues that came with travel, plus the issues that came with large events.</p>
            <p class="p-changes2">parking, hotels, restaurants, flights &ndash; it all needed to be accounted for.</p><br>
            <p class="p-changes2">our solution? "FieldDay," the app for the travelling fan.</p><br>
            <p class="p-changes2">FieldDay was positively received by our test subjects, as well as our instructor.</p><br>
            <p class="p-changes2">if we had more time, we would have loved to have taken the prototype to another round of testing. sadly, the quarter ended before we could.</p>
            <p class="p-changes2">you can play with the prototype yourself by using the window on the right.</p>
